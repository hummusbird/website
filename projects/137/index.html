            <h2>introduction</h2>
            <p>after coming across the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/saveitforparts">saveitforparts</a> youtube
                channel (and watching every video) i saw how easily and cheaply receiving usable imagary is. i'm
                personally more interested in the photography than the weather aspect, and these black and white, noisy
                feeds do have a unique feel to them.
            </p>

            <h2>the antenna (and how this works)</h2>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_picture_transmission">APT (automatic picture
                    transmission)</a> is an analog system for transmitting continuous images over radio -
                there are three american NOAA weather satellites that transmit APT signals at around 137MHz, which can
                be received very clearly with a makeshift antenna - literally two copper pipes, at 120 degrees, which is
                exactly what I did.<br><br>
                APT is a pretty old standard, and provides two low resolution monochrome images, one visible spectrum
                and one IR during daytime, and two different IR images during nighttime. it's significantly easier to
                get usable images, compared to higher freqency feeds like <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-resolution_picture_transmission">HRPT</a>.
            </p>

                <img class="half" alt="a laptop and the antenna on a brick wall" src="https://img.birb.cc/yvwvx2yE.jpg">
            </div>

            <p>my first antenna was a v-dipole, which is exactly what it sounds like. two poles in a V shape,
                specifically at 120 degrees and a length of 534mm, which is just under four times the length of a 137MHz
                radio wave.</p>

            <h2>first transmissions</h2>
            <p>unfortunately, the combination of location and imprecise antenna design resuled in
                pretty poor results. I'm using the open-source <a href="https://gqrx.dk/">GQRX software</a>, on my
                Arch Linux laptop to record the incoming signals - it's pretty simple, you just have to select your
                RTL-SDR device, select the right frequency, and hit record. My first pass, i recorded in stereo by
                accident, which completely ruined any chance of an image. Subsequent passes did end in visible
                images.

            <p>these images are decoded from .wav format into an image by another open source project, <a
                    href="https://noaa-apt.mbernardi.com.ar/">noaa-apt</a>. it's a modern alternative to the older
                wxtoimg software, which is closed-source and no longer supported. noaa-apt supports features like
                country overlay and false colour, which makes this images much more usable than just the unfiltered
                monochrome originals.

            <h2>v2 antenna</h2>
            <p>after getting half a dozen subpar images, i realised the need for a new antenna - not made out of fence
                panel and copper pipes. I bought two 3.5mm aluminium rods, and cut them down to the appropriate 534mm.
                My plan was to 3D print a frame, and solder the COAX cable to the poles, but due my iron or solder being
                terrible, i couldn't get the solder to stick at all. I instead used the grub-screw holes in my design,
                to friction fit the COAX copper and shielding. This worked remarkably well.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>visiting somewhere with clear LOS to the sky, and no buildings or surfaces to reflect signals definitely
                improved the quality of my images too. - my first pass with the V2 antenna got clear signal from
                northern africa, all the way to iceland.
            </p>

            <p>the only issue with this image is the split between IR and visible light - i recorded this at sunset,
                meaning the lack of sunlight produces a pretty unremarkable image. Passes in the morning or midday
                should produce better results</p>

            <h2>composite image</h2>
            <p>on the 22nd of July, i noticed there were three passes pretty close to one-another. NOAA-15 at 9:50AM,
                and then NOAA-19 and NOAA-15 at 10:20 and 10:50. The plan is to record all three passes, then combine
                the images digitally afterwards to create one larger composite. Since all three passes were in the
                morning, the visibility should be perfect!
            </p>

            <p>here you can see the three passes were colourised, cropped, then carefully stitched together. I was
                very pleased with the width of this image, the NOAA-15 west pass managed to get a significant chunk
                of Greenland, and shows some really interesting weather patterns over the Pacific.
                <br><br>
                i managed to record an even better pass of all three NOAA satellites the next day, going as far east as
                Turkey!
