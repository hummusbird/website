            <h2>introduction</h2>
            <p>after coming across the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/saveitforparts">saveitforparts</a> youtube
                channel (and watching every video) i saw how easily and cheaply receiving usable imagary is. i'm
                personally more interested in the photography than the weather aspect, and these black and white, noisy
                feeds do have a character to them
            </p>

            <h2>the antenna (and how this works)</h2>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_picture_transmission">APT (automatic picture
                    transmission)</a> is an analog system for transmitting continuous images over radio -
                there are three american NOAA weather satellites that transmit APT signals at around 137MHz, which can
                be received very clearly with a makeshift antenna - literally two copper pipes at 120 degrees, which is
                exactly what I did.<br><br>
                APT is a pretty old standard, and provides two low resolution monochrome images, one visible spectrum
                and one IR during daytime, and two different IR images during nighttime. it's significantly easier to
                get usable images, compared to higher freqency feeds like <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-resolution_picture_transmission">HRPT</a>
            </p>

            <p> my first antenna was a v-dipole, which is exactly what it sounds like. two poles in a V shape,
                specifically at 120 degrees and a length of 534mm, which is just under four times the length of a 137MHz
                radio wave.</p>
