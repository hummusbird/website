            <h2>the disk</h2>
            <p>recently at work i've had to use floppy disks - the 3.5 inch, 1.44 MB plastic rectangles from the 80s.
                younger people might never have even used one of these disks, which were so ubiquitous at their peak
                that we STILL use a floppy disk to represent the "save" icon in thousands of GUIs.
                <br><br>
                i want to do something... stupid with them.
                <br><br>
                humans love tangible things, even if equivalents are better in every way; just look at casettes, vinyls,
                even old iPods over streaming audio off your phone. It's worse in almost every way, except silly human
                brain go "oooo" - why can't floppy disks be the same?
            </p>

            <h2>the plan</h2>
            <p> they're 1.44MB - this is *just* big enough to fit a VERY compressed mp3 file, and what's better than
                only being able to fit one song on each disk? (this is such a stupid idea).
                <br>
                i want to keep this project absurdly simple too - if i'm going to make a jukebox floppy disk player,
                it's not going to have play or pause, no FF or RW, and to "skip" a song, you'll have to change the
                disk
                yourself. It's definitely going to be a gimmick, but so is using vinyls in 2023!
            </p>

            <p>it needs some kind of output, other than audio, so a small 16x2 LCD should fit the theme - It'll show the
                status of the player, and current song metadata.</p>
