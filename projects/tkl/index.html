            <h2>the plan</h2>
            <p>since the stalks on my Corsair K68 RGB started to wear out, i've been wanting a new keyboard,
                preferrably handmade, and without a numberpad for extra mouse space.<br><br>i couldn't find any premade
                PCBs in ISO for not a stupid amount of money, and handwiring my own is a much cheaper option than
                getting PCBs cut.
            </p>

            <h2>parts</h2>

            <p>my first handmade keyboard was shit - it used gateron blues, a (badly) 3D printed chassis <a
                    href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3478494">[sick68]</a> and a teensy 2.0. i forgot to buy
                stabilizers, but the concept was sound and it worked.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>teensy 2.0
                <li>~100 cherry MX reds
                <li>~100 1N4148 diodes
                <li>3D printed custom chassis
                <li>stripped ethernet cable
                <li>costar stabilizers
                <li><a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-matt3o-mt3-susuwatari-custom-keycap-set">susuwatari MT3 caps</a>
                <li>USB mini B cable
            </ul>

            <h2>chassis</h2>

            <div class="flex content">
                <img class="half" alt="isometric view of the keyboard chassis" src="https://img.birb.cc/k4NXQpbJ.png">
                <p>the chassis is designed in four parts, as my Anet A8+ 3D printer takes ~ 6 hours for each part. I
                    decided on a two-tone white and black finish, and utilized the glass bed of my printer to create
                    a mirror finish on the top surface.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="flex content">
                <p>the bottom casing is at a 3.5 degree angle, for more comfortable use. the top place sits on runners
                    inside the bottom casing. the parts can be "welded" together using a soldering iron.
                </p>

            <img class="fullwidth" alt="a dimension view of the key holes" src="https://img.birb.cc/hzNfEwo3.png">

            <p>i designed the entire model using Fusion 360 - i'm not too familiar with the software but did set out the
                sketch in such a way i can modify the positions of the keys later without too much hassle.</p>

            <h2>electronics:</h2>

            <p>a TKL ISO board with a full function row has 87 keys, 6 rows and 17 columns - the way a teensy works as a
                keyboard is by scanning each row and column to check for connections, so to hook up every key i'll need
                to use exactly 23 pins.
            </p>

            <img class="flip fullwidth" alt="a grid view of each key" src="https://img.birb.cc/jrUxbyoF.png">
            <p class="center">this image is flipped, as you have to solder each wire onto the back of the board, not the
                front
            </p>

            <img class="fullwidth" alt="a wiring diagram of the board" src="https://img.birb.cc/GL9D369q.png">
            <p class="center">this is the wiring diagram for the board - each row and column is hooked up to a different
                pin</p>

            <img class="fullwidth" alt="the teensy wired to each switch" src="https://img.birb.cc/RIRhn2qr.png">

            <h2>software</h2>

            <p>the teensy 2.0 can be turned into a keyboard controller using <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK</a>. you just
                need to set up the environment and specify a keymap. You can use my handwired keymap and modify it by
                forking my <a href="https://github.com/hummusbird/qmk_firmware">QMK fork</a>.
                <br><br>
                Once you have QMK set up, run this command and press the reset switch on the teensy:
                <br><br>
            </p>

            <p class="codeblock">
                qmk flash -kb teensy_handw -km default
            </p>

            <h2>extended 2048</h2>

            <p>the MT3 susuwatari keycaps i chose create a very nice contrast against the white case for the keyboard.
                the red enter + escape keys give it a very vibrant splash of colour too.
                <br><br>
                i'm very happy with the end result, and have <s>plans to make</s> made another keyboard in this style!
                <br><br>
                the only improvements from my previous design was the addition of a SSD1306 OLED display.
                this oled can be connected directly to the microcontroller, but i had issues with the larger 1.3"
                version and the teensy, instead opting for a smaller 0.9" one.
                <br><br>
                this keyboard was also entirely white, and used <a>MT3 Extended 2048</a> keycaps. very pretty.
            </p>
